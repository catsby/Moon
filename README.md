# Sinatra-Riak

"Sinatra-Riak" is at the moment a half thought out idea for making a [Sinatra App][sinatra] for viewing information/data in a [Riak][riak] cluster. It's like Basho's own [Rekon][rekon], except in Sinatra I guess.


Really this is just a filler README. I'll make an actually one tomorrow or soon after.
